# Blog filler app using react-query

Simple Blog app which calls an [apis](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) to retreive posts and comments.

This application uses [react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview) to do simple
queries to retreive data from an async calls and update data using mutation. The api's doesn't actually update the data but
mocks on how mutation works in react-query.
